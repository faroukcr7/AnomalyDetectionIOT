#Anomaly detection on IOT System 

## overview
This project was implemented to ameliorate an existing IOT project made by a friend of mine 
entitled by Smart  house  

The project is basicly a prototype  of an smart house that has multiple arduino  sensors (Proxmity , heating ... )  , so 
my amelioration was to add A DeepLearning Model to Make an anomaly detection of security breaches  , the collected date set can 
be found on the repo beside the code 

## Tools 
Python
Tensorflow 

## Usage 
To run the program just  : ``python3 demo.py``
